# Uber Fare Time Series Analysis

## Description
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of Uber fare data, focusing on time series forecasting and insights generation. The project applies advanced data analysis techniques using R, emphasizing trends, seasonality, and forecasting future fares with precision. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
- **R**: Ensure R is installed on your system.
- **R Libraries**:
  - `ggplot2`
  - `forecast`
  - `tseries`

### Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the project files:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Uber_Fare_Time_Series_Analysis.git
   ```
2. Open the R script (`scripts/analysis.R`) in RStudio.
3. Install required R packages by executing the following command in R:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("ggplot2", "forecast", "tseries"))
   ```

### Executing the Program
1. Load the dataset (`data/uber.csv`) by running the R script.
2. Follow the sequence of steps in the script for data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis.
3. Generated plots and outputs are saved in the `outputs/plots/` folder.
